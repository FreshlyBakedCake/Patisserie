# What is this?

Chimera is a shared NixOS and home-manager configuration, built using flakes and
[Snowfall Lib](https://github.com/snowfallorg/lib). Our aims are to support all
of our members' needs while allowing us to share work that would otherwise be
duplicated between us.

We are opinionated and often will not provide much customization in our modules,
only adding more than enable where we believe there to be a distinct probability
that multiple members will choose differently.

# Who shares it?

Currently:
- @minion (<https://a.starrysky.fyi>)
- @coded (<https://resume.coded.codes>)

If you'd like to join us, send us a message at
[chimera@clicks.codes](mailto:chimera@clicks.codes)!

# Can I get my patch submitted?

For sure! You need a review from at least 1 other chimera member who your patch
affects. If there's nobody matching this description and you are a chimera
member, submit away! If you're not a member then you'll need to become one - let
us know you're interested at [chimera@clicks.codes](mailto:chimera@clicks.codes)
